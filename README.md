## Getting Started

**Entrypoint:** index.php

> **Note:** This project requires access to a database that is no longer available

## Context

This project was made as a class assignment in 2018 with the following goals:

- Interact with data from a relational database
- Add accounts and passwords to a database
- Create login sessions
- Upload data via CSV file to database through PHP

Since making this project years ago, there are several changes I would make today. For starters, I would use better
password security methods such as a more modern encryption algorithm. I would also do more to sanitize the information
inputs to prevent hackers from injecting malicious code. While I'm aware of these concepts today, they were not part of
the scope of the class at the time I initially made it.

I developed this project through the second half of the semester.
